Some useful utilities:

1. CloseOrHide.app
   an apple script wrapped in app, that determines whether to close an app or hide an app.
   For example: OneNote for Mac quit on close, annoying, so we want to hide it by default.
   I have a mouse, I have assigned opening this app on clicking a special key on the mouse.
   So that app knows whether to close or hide an app.

2. clean_up_open_menu.sh
   There are some same items on your open with menu?
   Run this.
